**Remark:** This code is extracted from another project of mine and fulfills _our_ ([Genossenschaft Solutionsb√ºro](https://buero.io) daily needs of automated payment order generation. It does _not_ implement the whole specification of the [Swiss standard](https://www.six-group.com/interbank-clearing/dam/downloads/en/standardization/iso/swiss-recommendations/implementation-guidelines-ct.pdf). Further there is no safety net whatsoever. This comes without warranty of any kind. As this is about your money, think first.
